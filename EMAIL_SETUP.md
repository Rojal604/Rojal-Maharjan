3. Enable 2-Step Verification if not already enabled

### Step 2: Generate App Password
1. Go to Google Account settings
2. Navigate to Security â†’ 2-Step Verification
3. Scroll down to "App passwords"
4. Click "App passwords"
5. Select "Mail" and "Other (custom name)"
6. Enter "Portfolio Contact Form" as the name
7. Copy the generated 16-character password

### Step 3: Environment Variables
Create a `.env.local` file in your project root with:

```env
GMAIL_USER=rojalmaharjan052@gmail.com
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your_16_character_app_password_here
```

### Step 4: Test the Setup
1. Start your development server: `pnpm dev`
2. Navigate to the contact form
3. Fill out and submit the form

## Troubleshooting

If emails aren't being sent:
